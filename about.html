    <p>I hold a B.S. in Psychology from the University of Missouri - Columbia as well as a Minor in Business. I am currently completing a second B.S. in Computer Science. I've also completed specialized courses in Spatial Computing (COESC), healthcare, and am a Registered Behavior Technician</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Technical Skills</h2>
    <p>
   My technical experience includes programming in Java, C, C#, Python, and JavaScript. I'm currently interning with the RADaR Analytics team, where I’ve been working on software development and AI-driven analytics tools. I've built internal tools using Flask, integrated APIs, and worked with SQL and Snowflake to manage and query large datasets. I’ve also explored Tableau and Google Analytics to visualize data and measure user behavior. On the side, I’ve designed responsive websites, debugged complex UI interactions, and contributed to projects involving image processing, binary search trees, and system-level C programming. This website was also written by me!
